# Regression

## Overview

Welcome to the "Regression" repository! This repository contains various machine learning regression analyses. It showcases different algorithms applied to regression problems, including but not limited to Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, and more advanced techniques like Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks.

## Code Examples

### Loading and Preprocessing Data

The code examples in this repository include data loading, preprocessing, and transformation steps such as feature scaling and encoding.

### Model Implementation

Each regression algorithm is implemented in its respective script or Jupyter notebook, demonstrating:

- **Training**: How to train the model on the dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Techniques like Grid Search for finding the best model parameters.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and visualizations to assess model performance, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and more.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
